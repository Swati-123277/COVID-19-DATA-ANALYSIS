# COVID-19-DATA-ANALYSIS

This project focuses on extracting key insights from global COVID-19 data using advanced SQL queries. 
The data comprises metrics such as total cases, deaths, hospitalizations, vaccinations, and demographic details for different countries and continents.

Objective:- explore the spread, impact, and vaccination trends of COVID-19 across countries and continents,
             enabling a better understanding of its severity and management efforts.

Key Tasks Performed:
1. Analyzed the likelihood of death due to COVID-19 over time in India.

2. Calculated the percentage of total deaths and positive cases compared to the population for India and globally.
   
3. Identified countries and continents with the highest death rates and infection rates.

4. Combined vaccination and death datasets to understand elderly population (65+) trends and vaccination distribution.

5. Ranked countries based on the number of fully vaccinated individuals.

6. Compared new daily cases against hospitalizations and ICU admissions (India).

Insights Gained:

India’s death-to-case ratio and positive case ratio give insight into pandemic severity.

Europe and North America were among the continents with the highest reported cases and deaths.

Countries with high death percentages relative to population include smaller nations with low populations but significant case fatality.

Vaccination efforts vary significantly, with some countries reaching high levels of full vaccination and boosters, while others lag.

Older population (65+) demographics allowed targeted insights into vaccination planning.

Temporal analysis of hospitalizations vs new cases highlighted the pressure on healthcare systems.
